				<p><span class="h3 serif">For many years, I painted objects I could touch, objects close to me.</span> With them I created very architectural compositions. Still lives I was trying to animate with inert objects, daily objects assembled within their affinity and placed motionless on an horizontal setting, static, timeless, final.</p>
				<p>Then, to get out of this immutable world, I opened my windows. The marvels of the Venetian palaces dazzled me. With my first canvases, I copied facades the way one would copy a common apple. Later, leaving the creativity of the Venetian architects, I composed my own facades using various existing elements but assembled differently to create imaginary palaces.</p>
				<p>Since 2009, I have left both still lives and Venice. Off to the open sea. From a static world I left for a lively and dynamic one. The glasses of water from my still lives broke, the water from my carafes spread around and from my Venetian canals I went towards the sea. After the confined world of my still lives, immensity lays in front of me : the sea.</p>
