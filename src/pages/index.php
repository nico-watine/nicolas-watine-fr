Still lives I was trying to animate with inert objects, daily objects assembled within their affinity and placed motionless on an horizontal setting, static, timeless, final.</p>

Later, leaving the creativity of the Venetian architects, I composed my own facades using various existing elements but assembled differently to create imaginary palaces.</p>

The glasses of water from my still lives broke, the water from my carafes spread around and from my Venetian canals I went towards the sea. After the confined world of my still lives, immensity lays in front of me : the sea.</p>
